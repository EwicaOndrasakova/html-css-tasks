            <h2>First Steps into Space Tourism</h2>
            <p>
              Not long ago, a trip to space was reserved only for trained
              astronauts. Today, private companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and
              Virgin Galactic are opening the door to civilians. Early "space
              excursions" are short journeys above the Kármán line, offering
              just a few minutes of weightlessness and a breathtaking view of
              Earth from more than 100 km up.

            <h2>A Day Aboard a Spacecraft</h2>
            <p>
              Imagine sleeping in a floating sleeping bag strapped to the wall
              instead of a hotel bed. Breakfast comes in sealed pouches, and
              water is sipped from bags—cups simply don't work in microgravity.
              During the day, passengers gaze through windows at the Earth
              below, photograph the endless black of space, and enjoy the
              surreal feeling of drifting without weight.

            <h2>From the Moon to Mars</h2>
            <p>
              Today's space excursions may last only minutes or days, but the
              future looks much further. NASA and private companies are already
              planning missions to the Moon, building bases for longer stays,
              and setting their sights on Mars. These journeys will push human
              limits and transform space tourism from a short thrill into true
              interplanetary exploration.
